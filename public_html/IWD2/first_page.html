		<h1> This is an H1 heading </h1>
		Hello world
		I can make text <b>bold</b>, or <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u>
	This is text that has formatting in what we typed into our favourite plain text editor, but we have forgotten to tell the browser what we wanted. The text actually looked like this: 1/ first thing 2/ second thing 3/ third thing 4/ and so on until we finished. The width of the text matches the window size.
	<h2>This is an h2 heading to say that below is formatted text using paragraph wrapping </h2>
	<p> 1/ first thing </p>
	<p> 2/ second thing </p>
	<p> 3/ third thing </p>
	<p> Each line is wrapped with &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </p>
	<p> and to type those characters i had to write &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;</p>
	<pre> This part I wrapped with &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; to keep the formatting of vi. 
	I dont have to wrap each line
	individually
